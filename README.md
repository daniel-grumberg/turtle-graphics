# Turtle Graphics

This repo, serves as place to hold my course materials teaching programming to novice 13 year olds. The assumed set up
is a Python 3.x installation with support for the `turtle` package (which relies on `tkinter`.

## Structure

The repository contains the following:

- A markdown file for each session labelled by lesson number and associated project. These aim to introduce programming
  concepts as we go along focusing on one aspect of the turtle graphics environment at a time. They will contain a
  title, a learning objectives section, as well as a section dedicated to the practical exercise.
- A projects directory providing full implementations of the projects for demonstration purposes.

## Aims

Provide a stimulating environment with direct visual feedback for pupils to learn programming simple programs and
algorithms. The focus is on simple sequencing, common programming idioms, iteration, and problem solving. Simple data
strucutres such as arrays mght be brought into the mix time permitting.
